# BreakBox
A 'Break Out' inspired game created by myself as part of the CGRA151 (Computer graphics and games) course

Game physics was entirely self made

Game assets were orginally created using Microsoft Co-pilot and then edited/altered to fit my needs

To run, first download Processing (https://processing.org/download), then open BreakBox.pde and run

# How to play:
Use the mouse to move the 'bat' around the screen to hit the ball\
The goal of each level is to break all the boxes. When all the boxes are broken, you complete the level

The orange and grey boxes can survive one hit without breaking and must be hit twice to break\
The red and black boxes can survive two hits and must be hit three times to break\
The orange and blue boxes are called "Multi Boxes" and spawn in another ball which the player must keep in the air at all times\
The blue and green boxes are called "Speed Boxes" and speed up the ball for a limited amount of time

To complete the game, the player must clear both levels

Multi Boxes and Speed Boxes spawn in randomly at the creation of the level
