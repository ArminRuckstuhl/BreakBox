# BreakBox
A 'Break Out' inspired game created by myself as part of the CGRA151 (Computer graphics and games) course

Game physics was entirely self made

Game assets were orginally created using Microsoft Co-pilot and then edited/altered to fit my needs

To run, first download Processing (https://processing.org/download), then open BreakBox.pde and run
